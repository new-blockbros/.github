# New Block Bros

New Block Bros is a web version of [Block Bros](https://blockbros.net/).

The old version is built with [Cocos2d-x](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x), which is no longer maintained.

It makes the old Block Bros hard to be maintained and prevents it to be updated with new features.

We port Block Bros from Cocos2d-x using native JavaScript to what's more better - [Ebitengine](https://ebiten.org/), which is written in Go.
